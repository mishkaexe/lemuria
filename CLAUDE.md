# Core philosophy

TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions. This is not a suggestion or a preference - it is the fundamental practice that enables all other principles in this document.

I follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

# Bash commands
- go build: Build the project
- go mod tidy: Install or delete dependencies
- go test: Run tests
- go run: Execute a specific filep

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Follow a TDD methodology, always write unit tests before implementing the feature.
